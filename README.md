# Dance Dance Revolution clone for the PewPew console

≈Åukasz Langa did some work in 2022 on a PewPew emulator in the browser with the
help of [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/).

Using the example of a minimalistic DDR like with a resolution of only 8x8
pixels!

This is my attempt to run the game in an actual PyScript environment in 2023.
